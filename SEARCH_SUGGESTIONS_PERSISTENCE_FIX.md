# Search Suggestions Persistence & Collapse Issues - FIXED ✅

## 🐛 **Additional Issues Resolved**

### Issue 1: Previous Search Results Still Showing
**Problem**: When typing new search terms, old suggestions were persisting and mixing with new ones, causing confusion.

**Root Cause**: 
- Suggestions state wasn't being cleared immediately when new searches started
- Asynchronous state updates were causing stale data to persist
- No proper cleanup between suggestion generations

### Issue 2: Suggestions Not Collapsing on Products Page
**Problem**: When clicking on a suggestion in the products page, the suggestions stayed open and search remained expanded instead of applying the filter and collapsing.

**Root Cause**: 
- Products page `handleSearch` function wasn't collapsing the search UI
- No state reset for `searchExpanded` and `shouldHideHeader`
- Suggestions weren't being cleared when selection was made

## ✅ **Complete Fix Implementation**

### 1. Enhanced Suggestion Clearing in SearchBar
**File**: `components/SearchBar.tsx`

**Improved `handleSearch` Function:**
```tsx
const handleSearch = (query: string) => {
  if (!query.trim()) return;

  // Clear ALL suggestions immediately to prevent stale results
  setCombinedSuggestions([]);
  setShowSuggestions(false);

  // ... rest of search logic

  // Additional cleanup after a short delay to ensure state is cleared
  setTimeout(() => {
    setCombinedSuggestions([]);
    setShowSuggestions(false);
  }, 100);
};
```

**Enhanced `handleSuggestionPress` Function:**
```tsx
const handleSuggestionPress = (suggestion: SearchSuggestion) => {
  // Clear suggestions immediately when a suggestion is selected
  setCombinedSuggestions([]);
  setShowSuggestions(false);
  
  setSearchQuery(suggestion.text);
  handleSearch(suggestion.text);
};
```

**Improved Search Query Change Handler:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    setShowSuggestions(true);
    // Clear any existing suggestions before generating new ones
    setCombinedSuggestions([]);
  } else {
    setShowSuggestions(false);
    setCombinedSuggestions([]);
  }
}, [searchQuery]);
```

**Enhanced Suggestion Generation:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    // Add a small delay to ensure previous suggestions are cleared
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Generate fresh suggestions
      // ...suggestion generation logic
    }, 50); // Small delay to ensure clean state

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  } else {
    setCombinedSuggestions([]);
  }
}, [searchHistory, searchQuery]);
```

**Improved Toggle Handler:**
```tsx
const handleToggle = () => {
  if (isExpanded && searchQuery) {
    handleSearch(searchQuery);
  } else {
    onToggle();
    onExpandedChange?.(!isExpanded);
    
    // If collapsing, clear suggestions
    if (isExpanded) {
      setCombinedSuggestions([]);
      setShowSuggestions(false);
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Fixed Products Page Search Collapse
**File**: `app/(tabs)/products.tsx`

**Enhanced `handleSearch` Function:**
```tsx
const handleSearch = (query: string) => {
  setSearchQuery(query);
  // Close the search expansion when search is performed
  setSearchExpanded(false);
  setShouldHideHeader(false);
  // Note: SearchBar component now handles its own suggestions
};
```
